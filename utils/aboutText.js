const aboutText = `I remember the day I talked with my father on one of those lazy holiday weekends. I was enthusiastically describing a usual tech-marvel when I noticed how his eyes trailed off in a kind and yet pitiful smile. As if he was trying to say "Son, this is why we went out of our way for you to get educated as well as you did. To be part of this generation, not to gawk at its marvels."

And this...Is actually not how I got interested in tech at all.

Like everyone who zigzags through career paths in this age of scanty plenty, I was once a promising copywriter. Then deemed too much of a work-horse (and a strict taskmaster) and moved up to event management. Then a screenwriter. Then ricocheted into culinary arts, which catapulted me to open my first business. Which was good by the way. But the turmoil of the said times and well, my country, in general, made me call it quits. Since, you know, having tanks roll out unannounced near your business is a major investment buzzkill.

But the itch was there. When modding for your favorite game on a god-forsaken editor, without any inkling on what actually are you doing or when you're looking at a screen and wondering what sorcery compels that software to do what it does.

And finally one day I quoth "Nevermore" and never looked back.

I found solace in the challenge. Also noticed I barely knew anyone with tech background despite my eclectic social circle. So it became a 
game with no cheats and no tutorials. I took refuge in the fact that "I knew how to learn first" as the Bene Gesserits would say. I also learned my limitations as a human being. That it's a vast ocean that you can only drop anchor in its familiar and pleasant tides. And so I did.

I love creating. I love doing stuff. I like making them pleasant to look at. And I love how they get to work. So much that I just click through whatever functionality I conjured for hours just to watch them do their thing without protest.

I'm a web developer based in Turkey. And I would like to work with you. To help create what you're dreaming of. And maybe, to make that dream my own. Since creation is a collective process.
